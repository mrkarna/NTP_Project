# Distributed System: Time Synchronization

This repository develops a time synchronization service for a simple distributed system. The system consists of two parts - a server and a client - that implements a time synchronization protocol NTP. 
Multiple instances of the client can synchronize their respective clocks in parallel with the server.

The system works with the time synchronization server running on a remote cloud machine on AWS EC2 and client instances running on the local machine.
